# Guerrilla Analytics Portfolio – Gonçalo Passinhas

This repository contains selected university projects from my Master’s in Data Science and Marketing Analytics at Erasmus School of Economics. They illustrate my experience with R, data preparation, statistical modelling and behaviour-based segmentation, and my ability to turn raw data into clear, actionable insights.

## Projects

1. **Customer Churn Prediction with Logistic Regression** (`project1/`)  
   Predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company using logistic regression.  
   - Focus on data cleaning, model specification, multicollinearity diagnostics (VIF) and interpretation of odds ratios.  
   - Produces churn risk scores and concrete retention recommendations, directly transferable to player churn analysis in games.

2. **Hotel Customer Segmentation and Revenue Analysis** (`project2/`)  
   Segments hotel customers based on booking behaviour and revenue using k-means clustering.  
   - Uses elbow and silhouette methods to choose the number of clusters, then profiles segments on age, stay characteristics and revenue.  
   - Delivers targeted marketing and loyalty recommendations, analogous to player cohort and monetisation analysis.

> Note: Datasets used in these projects are either synthetic, publicly available, or anonymised to respect privacy and course policies.

## How to Navigate

- Each project folder (`project1/`, `project2/`) contains:
  - A `README.md` describing the goal, data, methods and key insights.  
  - The main analysis file (`.Rmd` or notebook) with the full code.
  - The report file (`.pdf`) knitted from the markdown file.
